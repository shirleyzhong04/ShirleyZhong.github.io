<h1>Exercise 2</h1>

<p> (<strong>Snap to Grid</strong>) The setup function was a huge help in this project since I had so many global variables
to work with. The keyChoice function was great to work with as well since it was cool being able to switch things up with a
press of a button.</p>
<p> Controls: </p>
<p> w/a/s/d = move around </p>
<p> mouse button = quokka </p>
<p> m/n = animal noises </p>
<p> c = cat </p>
<p> x = dog </p>
